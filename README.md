# Baby Names Datasets

Baby name datasets presented in different ways. I find myself going back to this dataset frequently, this will make it easier.

## Raw

```raw/us-names-by-state.csv``` includes the social security names data for the USA, with number of children born with a given name, by year, sex, and state. Only includes names that were given to 5+ births that year.
